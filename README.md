# ml_text_summarization
This GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of a text summarization model based on spaCy and heapq libraries. It can summarize input text into a shorter version highlighting the most important sentences and keywords, and can also extract text from PDFs and images using the PyPDF2 and pytesseract libraries, respectively.
