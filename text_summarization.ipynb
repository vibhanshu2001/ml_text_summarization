       "'NEW DELHI: Law Minister Kiren Rijiju alleged on Monday that the decision of Congress leaders to accompany Rahul Gandhi to a Surat court, where he will file an appeal against his conviction in a criminal defamation case, was a way of trying to exert \"undue pressure\" on the judiciary, a charge rejected by party chief Mallikarjun Kharge , who said it was a symbol of support and not a show of strength.Gandhi will be in Gujarat\\'s Surat city on Monday to file the appeal in a court against his conviction in the 2019 criminal defamation case over his \"Modi surname\" remarks.Senior Congress leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra , the chief ministers of three party-ruled states, other national and state leaders are likely to accompany him to the court, sources said.Gandhi\\'s lawyers said the matter is likely to be taken up for hearing by the sessions court on Monday itself.\"My point is very simple -- why the Congress party is trying to put this kind of undue pressure on the judiciary? There are means and ways to deal with judicial matters. But is this the way?\" Rijiju asked while talking to reporters in the Parliament House complex here.He wondered whether there has ever been a case in the past where an entire political party tried to \"gherao\" a court.\"When former prime minister P V Narasimha Rao was convicted Congress was quiet. P Chidambaram and D K Shivakumar didn\\'t get support against charges for which they are out on bail,\" the law minister wrote on Twitter.Only for Rahul Gandhi, the Congress is staging this \"drama\" as it considers a family and a person above the country and its laws, he added.Kharge said the decision taken by the party leaders to accompany Gandhi to the court was personal. \"Even in a small case, family members join and go to court. Here, it is about an entire party and he (Gandhi) is fighting for the country,\" the Congress chief told reporters here.He said the presence of the party leaders in Surat is not a \"show of strength\", but a \"symbol of support\" for Gandhi.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took to Twitter to hit back at Rijiju, saying, \"The man who threatens the judiciary, judges and ex-judges daily and also distorts history daily talking. Hypocrisy ki koi seema nahin hai Modi Kaal mein (There is no limit to hypocracy in Modi\\'s rule).\"Rijiju said when the Enforcement Directorate (ED) takes action, Congress leaders want to gherao the agency\\'s office. \"When the CBI takes action, they want to gherao the CBI. When a court gives a verdict, they want to take over the court complexes. These kind of activities demean democracy and every Indian must condemn it,\" he told reporters.Dubbing the Congress leaders\\' move to accompany the former party chief to court as \"sycophancy of one family\", the minister wondered whether the family was above the country.He said Gandhi might be going to Surat to file an appeal, but it is not required of a convict to go personally to do it.\"Generally, no convict goes personally. His going personally with a motley group of leaders and aides accompanying him is only a drama. What Rahul Gandhi is doing is also a childish attempt to bring pressure on the appellate court. All courts in the country are immune from such tactics,\" the minister wrote on Twitter.'"

    "mytext = \"What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. ipsum dolor sit amet...\""

Having alreadyread the headline, one wants to know\\nmore about the story. This quest for knowing more decides the content ofthe\\nlead. The four-Ws(who, what, where, when) -and–one-H(how) techniqueis\\nemployed to conveythe factualdetails ofthestory.\\nThewhy,however, helps in getting to the core ofthe issue and its reason for\\nhappening.\\nWHO: This involves giving answers to questions such as ‘Who all are\\ninvolved?’\\nWHAT:‘Whatisthestoryallabout?’typequestionsgovernthiscomponent\\nofthe lead.\\nWHEN:Informationabout thedateandtimeofthehappeningofthestory\\northescheduleddateandtimeoftheeventconstitutesthispart ofthelead.\\nWHERE: The place ofthe event is also to be included.\\nWHY:Factsaboutthereasonfortheoccurrenceofcertainthingsorevents\\nare also mentioned inthe lead so that the qualityofthe storyis enriched.\\nHOW: Giving answers to questions such as ‘How the series of events\\nunfolded?’constitutes thispart ofthelead.\\n9.2.3 Subject-Verb-Object Approach\\nForthereader’sclarity,leadwritersusuallyfollowasubject-verb-objectsentence\\nstructure that makesthe idea ofthe lead straightforward.

But quotesare generallyparaphrased to\\ndrop the words whichmaydecrease the story’s impact.

Its structure is\\nsimilarto that ofa descriptive lead.\\nExample:\\nAlmost thirty years ago, back in 1989, after years of uninterrupted\\nhappiness in her country home, the light went out of Mrs Divya’s life\\n- she lost her eyesight completely.

This is generally achieved\\nthroughaquestionoracolourfulquotebeingusedastheheadlineinitself.125Examples:\\nTop 5 tips of the magazine publishing trade.\\nWho stole his heart?\\nBye-bye Advani Ji.\\n9.6 HEADLINEWRITINGPROCESS\\nWriting a headline involves both the literary and technical aspects. Font size,\\npositioningoftext, font style,widthofthetextandpresentationaresomeofthe\\ntechnicalconsiderations. Selectionofwords, sentencestructureandtheheadline\\ntype are some ofthe literaryaspects.\\n9.6.1 Display and Point Size\\nHeadlines have to be designed to fit into the allotted space. Thus in a three-\\ncolumn (3-col) story, the headline must occupy three columns of type. In\\nlarger publications, generally one of the editors is assigned the job of\\ndetermining the headline size, while others decide the headline content.\\nA shorthand communication as 2-36-2 (two- thirty six-two) means that the\\nstoryhas two columns requiring a 36 point (pt) head arranged in two lines.\\nSuch a headline is also known as a double-decker head in the newsroomor\\nthe production department.\\nShorthandforheadlinesiswritteninthefollowingsequence:numberofcolumns,\\nthe type size and the number oflines. The height oftype size is measured in\\npoints while its width is measured in picas. The type sizes are standard. A\\ntype size, whichis equalto or smaller thanabout 12 pt., is best used for body\\ntextandisrarelyusedforheadlines. Largerthanthispoint isusedforheadlines\\nthat follow a font size in the range of14-84. Such headlines are also known\\nasdisplay type .\\n9.6.2 Width, Weight, and Style\\nWidthofa headlineis decidedbasedonthe newspaper columns allotted to the\\nnewsstory.Whenaheadlineisbiggerthanthecolumnspaceprovided, double-\\ndecker headline is used i.e., it is split in two lines instead of one. Setting the\\ndistance between letters, known as kerningthe text, also helps reduce space\\nbetweenthewords, allowingtheheadlineto fit into thegivenwidth.\\nThebolderthefontthegreateristheweightoftheheadline.Weight ofaheadline\\nsuggeststheprioritygiventothenewsstorybytheeditor.Weight isalso related\\nto the font style chosenfor writing the headline, e.g., a storywrittenin Light /\\nSemi Light style has lesser weight than that written in Condensed orBold.\\nSimilarly, the font style also helps to decide the weight of a news story. The\\nheadlines in sans serif font styles are soft news or feature news stories. The\\nheadlines in serif fonts have more weight. Newspapers using sans serif fonts\\nonly, opt fora font familyproviding themavarietyoffont styles and weights.\\n9.6.3 Deciding News Angle\\nGenerally, NewsAnglemeansperspectivebasedonsomeelement orpointofthe\\nstory.

Theycould be\\nunmarriedloversorhusband-wifeinamarriedhostel.Youranglecouldbe love-\\nand-studies go hand-in-hand or justlove in the name of studies .\\n9.6.4 Writing the Headline\\nThe best wayto write anattentiongrabbing headlineisto understandthestory\\nfully.Thus, having got agoodidea ofthe story, thesub-editoris ableto reflect\\nit correctly in the headline.

It is alabelandis similar to a book\\ntitle. Inshort, a headline without a verbis called a labelheadline.\\nExamples:\\nThis year’s Padma awards.\\nA season of Holi festivities.\\nA labelheadline is a rarityand is used in newspapers to show neutralityin its\\napproachto thestory.Alabelis neutralinits approachand is easilysearchable\\nin a database.\\nExample:\\nPM’s stand shows vengeance can be label-headed as The PM’s stand .\\n9.7.2 Descriptive Headline\\nAdescriptive headline is the one which describes the gist of a news story. It\\nmajorlyfocuses on4Ws and 1H ( who, what, when, where, how ) while the why\\npart ofthe storyisoftennot part oftheheadline. Descriptiveheadlines arealso\\ncalled as How toheadline when they are used for explaining the step-wise\\nprocessofdoingsomething.\\nExamples:\\nHow to form an Investing habit.\\nChennai team develops device to test anti-biotic resistance in just 6\\nhours.\\n9.7.3 Comment Headline\\nA comment headline is the one that interprets the news partly. It adds extra\\nmeaning to the headline bylooking for something that is going on behind the\\nscenesorbyanalyzingtheimplicationsofthenewsimmediatelyorinthelongrun.\\nComment does add colour to the headline and thus enhances its impact. The\\ntrendofusing comment inheadlineisgrowing thesedays.\\nExample:\\nDesperate Pakistan wants to sabotage the Indian bid in the FATF .\\n9.7.4 Quotation Headline\\nAquotationheadline is the one that usesquotes inorder that its impact is not\\nreduced or lost after it isparaphrased.Aquoteisnot a storyinitselfandhence\\nis used to emphasizea news angle or news point.

Inradio orTV, a headline is spokenjust beforethe news storyis broadcast.Aheadline’s role isto generate audience engagement bycatching theirattention. To draw the attentionofthe audience, editorsalso use pictorialillustrations or aquote fromthe story. A lead is the first paragraph of the story. After the headline, it is the most informativeandimpactfulpartoftheentirestory. Itsroleisto leadtheaudience into the story’smainbody. Theheadlinemayhaveanelementofsurpriseoraweaimedatgeneratingreader’s interest andthe leadsatiates that interest as wellas enhances the levelofuser- satisfaction.

Having alreadyread the headline, one wants to know more about the story. This quest for knowing more decides the content ofthe lead. The four-Ws(who, what, where, when) -and–one-H(how) techniqueis employed to conveythe factualdetails ofthestory. Thewhy,however, helps in getting to the core ofthe issue and its reason for happening. WHO: This involves giving answers to questions such as ‘Who all are involved?’ WHAT:‘Whatisthestoryallabout?’typequestionsgovernthiscomponent ofthe lead. WHEN:Informationabout thedateandtimeofthehappeningofthestory orthescheduleddateandtimeoftheeventconstitutesthispart ofthelead. WHERE: The place ofthe event is also to be included. WHY:Factsaboutthereasonfortheoccurrenceofcertainthingsorevents are also mentioned inthe lead so that the qualityofthe storyis enriched. HOW: Giving answers to questions such as ‘How the series of events unfolded?’constitutes thispart ofthelead. 9.2.3 Subject-Verb-Object Approach Forthereader’sclarity,leadwritersusuallyfollowasubject-verb-objectsentence structure that makesthe idea ofthe lead straightforward. Consequently, using active rather than passive voice is the most favoured way of writing a lead sentence. Examples: “Three people were killed on Tuesday .…” Alternatively, “ Three people died....” would also be acceptable. Twopeoplewerearrested.

Aprofessionalreporterwouldensurethatthemainpointsofthestoryarecovered inthelead.Failureto doso resultsinasituationknownasburiedleadordelayed leadwhichisthought to betheproofofthereporter’sinabilityto determinethe significanceofthestory. It needs to be emphasized that the lead is the opening paragraphinhard news storiesbut not necessarilyinfeaturestorieswhereintheleadiskept generallyin themiddleofthemainbodyofthestory.Theideaistoaddanelementofsurprise to it. Example: Two children were killed today when a car jumped the road divider near Nehru Park in Central Delhi and ran them down. Ten others in the group were injured with two in critical condition .1219.3.2 Descriptive Lead Asthenamesuggests, thistypeofleadismoredescriptiveandexplanatory.It is used to explaina person, or a scene or an event indetailin response to where andwhoquestions.Awell-writtendescriptiveleadisapicture-in-wordsdescription giving the audience afeelingofbeing onthespot where the news happened. Examples: Before going into a trance, Mrs Pamela Chowdhary slowly murmured five, four, three, two, one, and gave birth to a ten-pound baby girl. The government offensive launched to clear roving ISIS guerrillas has started giving results. Moreover, to get insightsfordescribingthe event lucidly, it is better to contact variouseyewitnesses. 9.3.3 Question Lead It issaidthat newspaperreaderslookforanswersinastory. Henceleadsposing questions are generallyavoided. However, a proactivequestioncanbeusedto generateinterestandtheanswertowhichisfoundinoneormoreofthefollowing paragraphsmakingthe bodyofthe story. Examples: What happened in the city of Delhi in the afternoon of 1stNovember 1984? Who all were involved and how did they harm the community? Mr Chowksi had fled the country without a valid passport. 9.3.4 Punch/Caption Lead Inthistypeoflead, strongverbsanddirect sentencesareusedwiththeobjective ofcreating maximumimpact. Suchanimpact is achieved byjolting the readers withactionwordswrittenina simple way. Examples: The Chancellor is dead. The RBI suffers monentary crisis. Thecaptionleadcomeshandywhenthecopywriterisarmedwithanunexpected piece ofinformationthat hasto be conveyed inahard-hittingmanner. Example: Neither trees nor birds. All gone . The above lead about the ill-effects of deforestation will be highly impactful. Punch leads are used sparingly so that their impact in terms of shock to the readersis retained. 9.4 KINDS OF LEADS II Leadscanalso becategorizedbaseduponthesubject orcontext ofthecontent. QuotationLead, Contrast Lead, Staccato Lead andYou Lead.HeadlineandLeadWriting122Editing 9.4.1 Quotation Lead Quotesprovide colour and credibilityto the storybyrecording the facts as theycome fromthenews maker. But quotesare generallyparaphrased to drop the words whichmaydecrease the story’s impact. The other objective ofparaphrasing is to save the newspaper space and so also the reader’s time. However, no paraphrasing is allowedat the cost ofintent and themeaning of the quote that is generallyintendedto add anelement ofinterest suchas surprise, humour, contrast or compassionto thestory. Example: In 1998, the Indian PM Atal Behari Vajpayee said to his fellow parliamentarians: Governments will come and go but the country must remain intact. 9.4.2 Contrast Lead Thistypeofleadis based ondrawing comparisonsbetweentwo situations.

Example: Two years ago, two school friends pooled in their pocket money to start a website to provide doctors’ service online.

Its structure is similarto that ofa descriptive lead. Example: Almost thirty years ago, back in 1989, after years of uninterrupted happiness in her country home, the light went out of Mrs Divya’s life - she lost her eyesight completely. This year in May her prayers were answered suddenly - now she could see. 9.4.4 You Lead You Lead addresses the reader directly. It maybe written as a question being asked to the reader or a statement that connects with the reader directly. Implications ofthe news event mayalso be used to developYou Lead. Example: If you are an empathetic leader, you will easily identify the signs of whether your subordinate wants to quit or is just bored. 9.4.5 Blind Identification Lead Inthis type oflead, the identification ofthe newsmaker is dropped or delayed becausewhathashappenedto himisofimportanceeventhoughheisnotawell123knownpersoninhiscommunity. However, hisnameisusedinthemainbodyof thestory.Thisisdonetoensurethattherelevanceandthenewsvalueofthestory are not lost. Examples: A 90-year-old man instead of his name.

This is generally achieved throughaquestionoracolourfulquotebeingusedastheheadlineinitself.125Examples: Top 5 tips of the magazine publishing trade. Who stole his heart? Bye-bye Advani Ji. 9.6 HEADLINEWRITINGPROCESS Writing a headline involves both the literary and technical aspects. Font size, positioningoftext, font style,widthofthetextandpresentationaresomeofthe technicalconsiderations. Selectionofwords, sentencestructureandtheheadline type are some ofthe literaryaspects. 9.6.1 Display and Point Size Headlines have to be designed to fit into the allotted space. Thus in a three- column (3-col) story, the headline must occupy three columns of type. In larger publications, generally one of the editors is assigned the job of determining the headline size, while others decide the headline content. A shorthand communication as 2-36-2 (two- thirty six-two) means that the storyhas two columns requiring a 36 point (pt) head arranged in two lines. Such a headline is also known as a double-decker head in the newsroomor the production department. Shorthandforheadlinesiswritteninthefollowingsequence:numberofcolumns, the type size and the number oflines. The height oftype size is measured in points while its width is measured in picas. The type sizes are standard. A type size, whichis equalto or smaller thanabout 12 pt., is best used for body textandisrarelyusedforheadlines. Largerthanthispoint isusedforheadlines that follow a font size in the range of14-84. Such headlines are also known asdisplay type . 9.6.2 Width, Weight, and Style Widthofa headlineis decidedbasedonthe newspaper columns allotted to the newsstory.Whenaheadlineisbiggerthanthecolumnspaceprovided, double- decker headline is used i.e., it is split in two lines instead of one. Setting the distance between letters, known as kerningthe text, also helps reduce space betweenthewords, allowingtheheadlineto fit into thegivenwidth. Thebolderthefontthegreateristheweightoftheheadline.Weight ofaheadline suggeststheprioritygiventothenewsstorybytheeditor.Weight isalso related to the font style chosenfor writing the headline, e.g., a storywrittenin Light / Semi Light style has lesser weight than that written in Condensed orBold. Similarly, the font style also helps to decide the weight of a news story. The headlines in sans serif font styles are soft news or feature news stories. The headlines in serif fonts have more weight. Newspapers using sans serif fonts only, opt fora font familyproviding themavarietyoffont styles and weights. 9.6.3 Deciding News Angle Generally, NewsAnglemeansperspectivebasedonsomeelement orpointofthe story.

Under headline pressures, most sub-editors/copy editorsonlyread the opening linesofthe storyto come upwitha headline.At times, afactorafigureburiedinthebodytext canalsobeusedasasellingpoint intheheadline. Afterwritingtheheadline, one shouldalwaysget a third-personto checkit for its language and impact. Headlines using redundant words are best-dropped. Similarly,ambiguityhasnoplaceinheadlines.

It is alabelandis similar to a book title. Inshort, a headline without a verbis called a labelheadline. Examples: This year’s Padma awards. A season of Holi festivities. A labelheadline is a rarityand is used in newspapers to show neutralityin its approachto thestory.Alabelis neutralinits approachand is easilysearchable in a database. Example: PM’s stand shows vengeance can be label-headed as The PM’s stand . 9.7.2 Descriptive Headline Adescriptive headline is the one which describes the gist of a news story. It majorlyfocuses on4Ws and 1H ( who, what, when, where, how ) while the why part ofthe storyisoftennot part oftheheadline. Descriptiveheadlines arealso called as How toheadline when they are used for explaining the step-wise processofdoingsomething. Examples: How to form an Investing habit. Chennai team develops device to test anti-biotic resistance in just 6 hours. 9.7.3 Comment Headline A comment headline is the one that interprets the news partly. It adds extra meaning to the headline bylooking for something that is going on behind the scenesorbyanalyzingtheimplicationsofthenewsimmediatelyorinthelongrun. Comment does add colour to the headline and thus enhances its impact. The trendofusing comment inheadlineisgrowing thesedays. Example: Desperate Pakistan wants to sabotage the Indian bid in the FATF . 9.7.4 Quotation Headline Aquotationheadline is the one that usesquotes inorder that its impact is not reduced or lost after it isparaphrased.Aquoteisnot a storyinitselfandhence is used to emphasizea news angle or news point. That is whyquotes are used sparselyinheadlines.128Editing Examples: I didnot kill her and I do not want to be hanged. I am in full command and will get a second term: PM 9.7.5 Question Headline Aquestionheadline is the one that evokescuriosityand highlights speculative points or provokes the reader. It is also good for pro-and-con stories. Many professionalsdo not favourit becauseit leavesthereaderguessingwhereasthe jobofa headline is to make sure that its meaning is grasped clearly.

These headline props comeindifferent formats serving different purposes. It is well- knownthat anewsreport structuredinaninverted pyramidstyle lifts the most important newspointto thetopofthestoryknownasleadorintro.Thatiswhy mostheadlinesarebuiltonthenewspointcontainedinthelead.However,several newsreports-especiallydevelopingandanalyticalstories-arebuilt onmorethan onenewspoint. Insuchcases, headlinewriterstakethemost important point in the main headline and use a headline prop to draw attention to the remaining importantpoints. In this sense, headline props are supporting headlines. Headline props can be categorizedasfollows: 9.8.1 Shoulder or Kicker Ashoulderorkickerisasupportingheadlineplacedontopofthemainheadline andissmallerinsizebydefinition. Earlier, itwasusedto highlightthesubject of thestorybutthesedaysit isalso usedtohighlightthenewspointsnot contained inthemainheadline. Examples: Shoulder: India makes contact to meet negotiator today ; Main headline: Iraq captors give 24 more hours . In a newspaper, it is printed as follows: India makes contact to meet negotiator today Iraq captors give 24 more hours 9.8.2 Strapline Intermsofitspositioning, astraplinemaybedefinedasthereverseofkickeror shoulderasitisplacedbeneaththemainheadline.Otherattributesofstraplineare almost thesameasthat ofakickeror ashoulder.Astrapline worksasanextra hook to draw the reader into a story. This is done by providing additional informationthatmakesiteasyforthereaderswhoareinahurrytoscantheday’s headlines. Usually, a strapline is usedina single columnformat just below the mainheadlineanditspoint sizeis kept lessthanthat ofthe mainheadline. This differenceinpoint sizehelpsthereader to tellthemainpointsofthenewsstory fromitssubsidiarypoints. Likeshouldersofthepage,straplinesaresetinreverse and against colour backgrounds to add to the appealofthe page.

Inradio orTV, a headline is spokenjust beforethe news storyis broadcast.Aheadline’s role isto generate audience engagement bycatching theirattention. To draw the attentionofthe audience, editorsalso use pictorialillustrations or aquote fromthe story. A lead is the first paragraph of the story. After the headline, it is the most informativeandimpactfulpartoftheentirestory. Itsroleisto leadtheaudience into the story’smainbody. Theheadlinemayhaveanelementofsurpriseoraweaimedatgeneratingreader’s interest andthe leadsatiates that interest as wellas enhances the levelofuser- satisfaction.

LEARNINGOUTCOMES After reading theUnit, youwillbeableto: understand the processofwritingleads and headlines; describe their keyelements;and explainthefactorsshapingtheirstructureandlength.. LEADS Next onlyto headlines,leadsplayasignificant part inconvincingpeopleto read thenewsstory.Notthat creativityisnotaconsiderationatallbut thefoundation ofwritingagoodleadcontinuesto beitsobjectivityandthefactualcontent.To avoid informationoverload, a good lead is betterwrittenwithin-words. .. Definition of a Lead A lead is defined as the opening paragraph ofa news storywhich is crisp and hastheroleofgrabbingthereader’sattention.Itisanoutlineofwhat willfollow inthe subsequent paragraphsindetail. .. The Ws and H Appr oach: Alllead writers follow the Ws (WHAT,WHEN, WHO,WHERE, WHY)and -H (HOW) approach. Having alreadyread the headline, one wants to know more about the story. This quest for knowing more decides the content ofthe lead. The four-Ws(who, what, where, when) -and–one-H(how) techniqueis employed to conveythe factualdetails ofthestory. Thewhy,however, helps in getting to the core ofthe issue and its reason for happening. WHO: This involves giving answers to questions such as ‘Who all are involved?’ WHAT:‘Whatisthestoryallabout?’typequestionsgovernthiscomponent ofthe lead. WHEN:Informationabout thedateandtimeofthehappeningofthestory orthescheduleddateandtimeoftheeventconstitutesthispart ofthelead. WHERE: The place ofthe event is also to be included. WHY:Factsaboutthereasonfortheoccurrenceofcertainthingsorevents are also mentioned inthe lead so that the qualityofthe storyis enriched. HOW: Giving answers to questions such as ‘How the series of events unfolded?’constitutes thispart ofthelead. .. Subject-Verb-Object Approach Forthereader’sclarity,leadwritersusuallyfollowasubject-verb-objectsentence structure that makesthe idea ofthe lead straightforward. Consequently, using active rather than passive voice is the most favoured way of writing a lead sentence. Examples: “Three people were killed on Tuesday .…” Alternatively, “ Three people died....” would also be acceptable. Twopeoplewerearrested.

Aprofessionalreporterwouldensurethatthemainpointsofthestoryarecovered inthelead.Failureto doso resultsinasituationknownasburiedleadordelayed leadwhichisthought to betheproofofthereporter’sinabilityto determinethe significanceofthestory.

Example: Two children were killed today when a car jumped the road divider near Nehru Park in Central Delhi and ran them down. Ten others in the group were injured with two in critical condition ... Descriptive Lead Asthenamesuggests, thistypeofleadismoredescriptiveandexplanatory.It is used to explaina person, or a scene or an event indetailin response to where andwhoquestions.Awell-writtendescriptiveleadisapicture-in-wordsdescription giving the audience afeelingofbeing onthespot where the news happened. Examples: Before going into a trance, Mrs Pamela Chowdhary slowly murmured five, four, three, two, one, and gave birth to a ten-pound baby girl. The government offensive launched to clear roving ISIS guerrillas has started giving results. Moreover, to get insightsfordescribingthe event lucidly, it is better to contact variouseyewitnesses. .. Question Lead It issaidthat newspaperreaderslookforanswersinastory. Henceleadsposing questions are generallyavoided. However, a proactivequestioncanbeusedto generateinterestandtheanswertowhichisfoundinoneormoreofthefollowing paragraphsmakingthe bodyofthe story. Examples: What happened in the city of Delhi in the afternoon of stNovember ? Who all were involved and how did they harm the community? Mr Chowksi had fled the country without a valid passport. .. Punch/Caption Lead Inthistypeoflead, strongverbsanddirect sentencesareusedwiththeobjective ofcreating maximumimpact.

Thecaptionleadcomeshandywhenthecopywriterisarmedwithanunexpected piece ofinformationthat hasto be conveyed inahard-hittingmanner. Example: Neither trees nor birds. All gone . The above lead about the ill-effects of deforestation will be highly impactful. Punch leads are used sparingly so that their impact in terms of shock to the readersis retained. . KINDS OF LEADS II Leadscanalso becategorizedbaseduponthesubject orcontext ofthecontent. QuotationLead, Contrast Lead, Staccato Lead andYou Lead.HeadlineandLeadWritingEditing .. Quotation Lead Quotesprovide colour and credibilityto the storybyrecording the facts as theycome fromthenews maker. But quotesare generallyparaphrased to drop the words whichmaydecrease the story’s impact. The other objective ofparaphrasing is to save the newspaper space and so also the reader’s time. However, no paraphrasing is allowedat the cost ofintent and themeaning of the quote that is generallyintendedto add anelement ofinterest suchas surprise, humour, contrast or compassionto thestory. Example: In , the Indian PM Atal Behari Vajpayee said to his fellow parliamentarians: Governments will come and go but the country must remain intact. .. Contrast Lead Thistypeofleadis based ondrawing comparisonsbetweentwo situations. Suchcomparisonsbetweenwhat washappening thenand what is happening now, betweenold age and youthor evenbetweenwhat is happening elsewhereandwhat ishappening here—the locationofnewsevent. Example: Two years ago, two school friends pooled in their pocket money to start a website to provide doctors’ service online. Today that website has  million unique visitors and , regular clients . .. Staccato Lead Staccato lead is used whenthetimeelement isat the primefocus and the most important informationisinthelastline.Tocommunicatetheprogressionintime, a series ofphrases with recurring punctuation marks are used. Its structure is similarto that ofa descriptive lead. Example: Almost thirty years ago, back in , after years of uninterrupted happiness in her country home, the light went out of Mrs Divya’s life - she lost her eyesight completely. This year in May her prayers were answered suddenly - now she could see. .. You Lead You Lead addresses the reader directly. It maybe written as a question being asked to the reader or a statement that connects with the reader directly. Implications ofthe news event mayalso be used to developYou Lead. Example: If you are an empathetic leader, you will easily identify the signs of whether your subordinate wants to quit or is just bored. .. Blind Identification Lead Inthis type oflead, the identification ofthe newsmaker is dropped or delayed becausewhathashappenedto himisofimportanceeventhoughheisnotawellknownpersoninhiscommunity. However, hisnameisusedinthemainbodyof thestory.Thisisdonetoensurethattherelevanceandthenewsvalueofthestory are not lost. Examples: A -year-old man instead of his name.

This is generally achieved throughaquestionoracolourfulquotebeingusedastheheadlineinitself.Examples: Top  tips of the magazine publishing trade. Who stole his heart? Bye-bye Advani Ji. . HEADLINEWRITINGPROCESS Writing a headline involves both the literary and technical aspects. Font size, positioningoftext, font style,widthofthetextandpresentationaresomeofthe technicalconsiderations. Selectionofwords, sentencestructureandtheheadline type are some ofthe literaryaspects. .. Display and Point Size Headlines have to be designed to fit into the allotted space. Thus in a three- column (-col) story, the headline must occupy three columns of type. In larger publications, generally one of the editors is assigned the job of determining the headline size, while others decide the headline content. A shorthand communication as -- (two- thirty six-two) means that the storyhas two columns requiring a  point (pt) head arranged in two lines. Such a headline is also known as a double-decker head in the newsroomor the production department. Shorthandforheadlinesiswritteninthefollowingsequence:numberofcolumns, the type size and the number oflines. The height oftype size is measured in points while its width is measured in picas. The type sizes are standard. A type size, whichis equalto or smaller thanabout  pt., is best used for body textandisrarelyusedforheadlines. Largerthanthispoint isusedforheadlines that follow a font size in the range of-. Such headlines are also known asdisplay type . .. Width, Weight, and Style Widthofa headlineis decidedbasedonthe newspaper columns allotted to the newsstory.Whenaheadlineisbiggerthanthecolumnspaceprovided, double- decker headline is used i.e., it is split in two lines instead of one. Setting the distance between letters, known as kerningthe text, also helps reduce space betweenthewords, allowingtheheadlineto fit into thegivenwidth. Thebolderthefontthegreateristheweightoftheheadline.Weight ofaheadline suggeststheprioritygiventothenewsstorybytheeditor.Weight isalso related to the font style chosenfor writing the headline, e.g., a storywrittenin Light / Semi Light style has lesser weight than that written in Condensed orBold. Similarly, the font style also helps to decide the weight of a news story. The headlines in sans serif font styles are soft news or feature news stories. The headlines in serif fonts have more weight. Newspapers using sans serif fonts only, opt fora font familyproviding themavarietyoffont styles and weights. ..

HEADLINE PROPS Headline props are referred to as supporting headlines that provide the much needed extra words and space to make the headline more meaningful. These headline props comeindifferent formats serving different purposes. It is well- knownthat anewsreport structuredinaninverted pyramidstyle lifts the most important newspointto thetopofthestoryknownasleadorintro.Thatiswhy mostheadlinesarebuiltonthenewspointcontainedinthelead.However,several newsreports-especiallydevelopingandanalyticalstories-arebuilt onmorethan onenewspoint. Insuchcases, headlinewriterstakethemost important point in the main headline and use a headline prop to draw attention to the remaining importantpoints. In this sense, headline props are supporting headlines. Headline props can be categorizedasfollows: .. Shoulder or Kicker Ashoulderorkickerisasupportingheadlineplacedontopofthemainheadline andissmallerinsizebydefinition. Earlier, itwasusedto highlightthesubject of thestorybutthesedaysit isalso usedtohighlightthenewspointsnot contained inthemainheadline. Examples: Shoulder: India makes contact to meet negotiator today ; Main headline: Iraq captors give  more hours . In a newspaper, it is printed as follows: India makes contact to meet negotiator today Iraq captors give  more hours .. Strapline Intermsofitspositioning, astraplinemaybedefinedasthereverseofkickeror shoulderasitisplacedbeneaththemainheadline.Otherattributesofstraplineare almost thesameasthat ofakickeror ashoulder.Astrapline worksasanextra hook to draw the reader into a story. This is done by providing additional informationthatmakesiteasyforthereaderswhoareinahurrytoscantheday’s headlines. Usually, a strapline is usedina single columnformat just below the mainheadlineanditspoint sizeis kept lessthanthat ofthe mainheadline. This differenceinpoint sizehelpsthereader to tellthemainpointsofthenewsstory fromitssubsidiarypoints. Likeshouldersofthepage,straplinesaresetinreverse and against colour backgrounds to add to the appealofthe page. Examples: Main headline: Sensex gains  points ; Strapline: Revival of monsoons has done the magic. Straplinesmayalso beusedto linktherelatednewsreports, publishedthesame dayoronsubsequent days.Thisisdonethroughtheuseofakeywordto indicate that the reports are related.

Ina newspaper, it mayappear as follows: She packed her bags, was ready to leave NAFISA: Was to marrynext week, Momblames fiancé for her suicide Main headline: ‘She touched us with her elegance’; Strapline: NAFISA: An MTV colleague recounts... ..

FEATUREHEADLINES Feature headlines are used for feature stories or soft news stories. They are differentfromtheheadlinesusedforhardnewsstories.Insteadofrelyingonfacts of the news content solely, these also add a surprise or colour factor for the reader. ..Difference from News Headlines Afeaturestory,unlikehardnews,hasamorepersonalizedandsubjectiveapproach to the subject. Consequently, more adjectives and verbs are allowed infeatureheadlines which canbe wittyand have inthemanelement ofsurprise.Allthis lendsflexibilityinthe use offont andcolourinheadlinesthat maynot beinthe same font or colour as that ofthe bodytext.

Definition of a Lead A lead is defined as the opening paragraph ofa news storywhich is crisp and hastheroleofgrabbingthereader’sattention.Itisanoutlineofwhat willfollow inthe subsequent paragraphsindetail.   The Ws and H Appr oach: Alllead writers follow the Ws (WHAT,WHEN, WHO,WHERE, WHY)and -H (HOW) approach. Having alreadyread the headline, one wants to know more about the story. This quest for knowing more decides the content ofthe lead. The four-Ws(who, what, where, when) -and–one-H(how) techniqueis employed to conveythe factualdetails ofthestory. Thewhy,however, helps in getting to the core ofthe issue and its reason for happening. WHO: This involves giving answers to questions such as ‘Who all are involved?’ WHAT:‘Whatisthestoryallabout?’typequestionsgovernthiscomponent ofthe lead. WHEN:Informationabout thedateandtimeofthehappeningofthestory orthescheduleddateandtimeoftheeventconstitutesthispart ofthelead. WHERE: The place ofthe event is also to be included. WHY:Factsaboutthereasonfortheoccurrenceofcertainthingsorevents are also mentioned inthe lead so that the qualityofthe storyis enriched. HOW: Giving answers to questions such as ‘How the series of events unfolded?’constitutes thispart ofthelead.   Subject-Verb-Object Approach Forthereader’sclarity,leadwritersusuallyfollowasubject-verb-objectsentence structure that makesthe idea ofthe lead straightforward. Consequently, using active rather than passive voice is the most favoured way of writing a lead sentence. Examples: “Three people were killed on Tuesday .…” Alternatively, “ Three people died  ” would also be acceptable. Twopeoplewerearrested. Analternativeapproachbeginswiththepolice: The police arrested two people.

Aprofessionalreporterwouldensurethatthemainpointsofthestoryarecovered inthelead.Failureto doso resultsinasituationknownasburiedleadordelayed leadwhichisthought to betheproofofthereporter’sinabilityto determinethe significanceofthestory. It needs to be emphasized that the lead is the opening paragraphinhard news storiesbut not necessarilyinfeaturestorieswhereintheleadiskept generallyin themiddleofthemainbodyofthestory.Theideaistoaddanelementofsurprise to it. Example: Two children were killed today when a car jumped the road divider near Nehru Park in Central Delhi and ran them down. Ten others in the group were injured with two in critical condition  . Descriptive Lead Asthenamesuggests, thistypeofleadismoredescriptiveandexplanatory.It is used to explaina person, or a scene or an event indetailin response to where andwhoquestions.Awell-writtendescriptiveleadisapicture-in-wordsdescription giving the audience afeelingofbeing onthespot where the news happened. Examples: Before going into a trance, Mrs Pamela Chowdhary slowly murmured five, four, three, two, one, and gave birth to a ten-pound baby girl. The government offensive launched to clear roving ISIS guerrillas has started giving results. Moreover, to get insightsfordescribingthe event lucidly, it is better to contact variouseyewitnesses.   Question Lead It issaidthat newspaperreaderslookforanswersinastory. Henceleadsposing questions are generallyavoided. However, a proactivequestioncanbeusedto generateinterestandtheanswertowhichisfoundinoneormoreofthefollowing paragraphsmakingthe bodyofthe story. Examples: What happened in the city of Delhi in the afternoon of stNovember ? Who all were involved and how did they harm the community? Mr Chowksi had fled the country without a valid passport.   Punch/Caption Lead Inthistypeoflead, strongverbsanddirect sentencesareusedwiththeobjective ofcreating maximumimpact. Suchanimpact is achieved byjolting the readers withactionwordswrittenina simple way. Examples: The Chancellor is dead. The RBI suffers monentary crisis. Thecaptionleadcomeshandywhenthecopywriterisarmedwithanunexpected piece ofinformationthat hasto be conveyed inahard-hittingmanner. Example: Neither trees nor birds. All gone . The above lead about the ill-effects of deforestation will be highly impactful. Punch leads are used sparingly so that their impact in terms of shock to the readersis retained. . KINDS OF LEADS II Leadscanalso becategorizedbaseduponthesubject orcontext ofthecontent. QuotationLead, Contrast Lead, Staccato Lead andYou Lead.HeadlineandLeadWritingEditing   Quotation Lead Quotesprovide colour and credibilityto the storybyrecording the facts as theycome fromthenews maker. But quotesare generallyparaphrased to drop the words whichmaydecrease the story’s impact. The other objective ofparaphrasing is to save the newspaper space and so also the reader’s time. However, no paraphrasing is allowedat the cost ofintent and themeaning of the quote that is generallyintendedto add anelement ofinterest suchas surprise, humour, contrast or compassionto thestory. Example: In , the Indian PM Atal Behari Vajpayee said to his fellow parliamentarians: Governments will come and go but the country must remain intact.   Contrast Lead Thistypeofleadis based ondrawing comparisonsbetweentwo situations. Suchcomparisonsbetweenwhat washappening thenand what is happening now, betweenold age and youthor evenbetweenwhat is happening elsewhereandwhat ishappening here—the locationofnewsevent. Example: Two years ago, two school friends pooled in their pocket money to start a website to provide doctors’ service online. Today that website has  million unique visitors and , regular clients .   Staccato Lead Staccato lead is used whenthetimeelement isat the primefocus and the most important informationisinthelastline.Tocommunicatetheprogressionintime, a series ofphrases with recurring punctuation marks are used. Its structure is similarto that ofa descriptive lead. Example: Almost thirty years ago, back in , after years of uninterrupted happiness in her country home, the light went out of Mrs Divya’s life - she lost her eyesight completely. This year in May her prayers were answered suddenly - now she could see.   You Lead You Lead addresses the reader directly. It maybe written as a question being asked to the reader or a statement that connects with the reader directly. Implications ofthe news event mayalso be used to developYou Lead. Example: If you are an empathetic leader, you will easily identify the signs of whether your subordinate wants to quit or is just bored.   Blind Identification Lead Inthis type oflead, the identification ofthe newsmaker is dropped or delayed becausewhathashappenedto himisofimportanceeventhoughheisnotawellknownpersoninhiscommunity. However, hisnameisusedinthemainbodyof thestory.Thisisdonetoensurethattherelevanceandthenewsvalueofthestory are not lost. Examples: A -year-old man instead of his name.

HEADLINEWRITINGPROCESS Writing a headline involves both the literary and technical aspects. Font size, positioningoftext, font style,widthofthetextandpresentationaresomeofthe technicalconsiderations. Selectionofwords, sentencestructureandtheheadline type are some ofthe literaryaspects.   Display and Point Size Headlines have to be designed to fit into the allotted space. Thus in a three- column (-col) story, the headline must occupy three columns of type. In larger publications, generally one of the editors is assigned the job of determining the headline size, while others decide the headline content. A shorthand communication as -- (two- thirty six-two) means that the storyhas two columns requiring a  point (pt) head arranged in two lines. Such a headline is also known as a double-decker head in the newsroomor the production department. Shorthandforheadlinesiswritteninthefollowingsequence:numberofcolumns, the type size and the number oflines. The height oftype size is measured in points while its width is measured in picas. The type sizes are standard. A type size, whichis equalto or smaller thanabout  pt., is best used for body textandisrarelyusedforheadlines. Largerthanthispoint isusedforheadlines that follow a font size in the range of-. Such headlines are also known asdisplay type .   Width, Weight, and Style Widthofa headlineis decidedbasedonthe newspaper columns allotted to the newsstory.Whenaheadlineisbiggerthanthecolumnspaceprovided, double- decker headline is used i.e., it is split in two lines instead of one. Setting the distance between letters, known as kerningthe text, also helps reduce space betweenthewords, allowingtheheadlineto fit into thegivenwidth.

KINDSOFHEADLINES Headlinescanbeclassifiedintovariouscategoriesbasedontheirstructure,context, presentationandpositioning.   Label Headline This type ofheadlinedoes not have a verb. It is alabelandis similar to a book title. Inshort, a headline without a verbis called a labelheadline. Examples: This year’s Padma awards. A season of Holi festivities. A labelheadline is a rarityand is used in newspapers to show neutralityin its approachto thestory.Alabelis neutralinits approachand is easilysearchable in a database. Example: PM’s stand shows vengeance can be label-headed as The PM’s stand .   Descriptive Headline Adescriptive headline is the one which describes the gist of a news story. It majorlyfocuses onWs and H ( who, what, when, where, how ) while the why part ofthe storyisoftennot part oftheheadline. Descriptiveheadlines arealso called as How toheadline when they are used for explaining the step-wise processofdoingsomething. Examples: How to form an Investing habit. Chennai team develops device to test anti-biotic resistance in just  hours.   Comment Headline A comment headline is the one that interprets the news partly. It adds extra meaning to the headline bylooking for something that is going on behind the scenesorbyanalyzingtheimplicationsofthenewsimmediatelyorinthelongrun. Comment does add colour to the headline and thus enhances its impact. The trendofusing comment inheadlineisgrowing thesedays. Example: Desperate Pakistan wants to sabotage the Indian bid in the FATF .   Quotation Headline Aquotationheadline is the one that usesquotes inorder that its impact is not reduced or lost after it isparaphrased.Aquoteisnot a storyinitselfandhence is used to emphasizea news angle or news point. That is whyquotes are used sparselyinheadlines.Editing Examples: I didnot kill her and I do not want to be hanged. I am in full command and will get a second term: PM   Question Headline Aquestionheadline is the one that evokescuriosityand highlights speculative points or provokes the reader. It is also good for pro-and-con stories. Many professionalsdo not favourit becauseit leavesthereaderguessingwhereasthe jobofa headline is to make sure that its meaning is grasped clearly.

HEADLINE PROPS Headline props are referred to as supporting headlines that provide the much needed extra words and space to make the headline more meaningful. These headline props comeindifferent formats serving different purposes. It is well- knownthat anewsreport structuredinaninverted pyramidstyle lifts the most important newspointto thetopofthestoryknownasleadorintro.Thatiswhy mostheadlinesarebuiltonthenewspointcontainedinthelead.However,several newsreports-especiallydevelopingandanalyticalstories-arebuilt onmorethan onenewspoint. Insuchcases, headlinewriterstakethemost important point in the main headline and use a headline prop to draw attention to the remaining importantpoints. In this sense, headline props are supporting headlines. Headline props can be categorizedasfollows:   Shoulder or Kicker Ashoulderorkickerisasupportingheadlineplacedontopofthemainheadline andissmallerinsizebydefinition. Earlier, itwasusedto highlightthesubject of thestorybutthesedaysit isalso usedtohighlightthenewspointsnot contained inthemainheadline. Examples: Shoulder: India makes contact to meet negotiator today ; Main headline: Iraq captors give  more hours . In a newspaper, it is printed as follows: India makes contact to meet negotiator today Iraq captors give  more hours   Strapline Intermsofitspositioning, astraplinemaybedefinedasthereverseofkickeror shoulderasitisplacedbeneaththemainheadline.Otherattributesofstraplineare almost thesameasthat ofakickeror ashoulder.Astrapline worksasanextra hook to draw the reader into a story. This is done by providing additional informationthatmakesiteasyforthereaderswhoareinahurrytoscantheday’s headlines. Usually, a strapline is usedina single columnformat just below the mainheadlineanditspoint sizeis kept lessthanthat ofthe mainheadline. This differenceinpoint sizehelpsthereader to tellthemainpointsofthenewsstory fromitssubsidiarypoints. Likeshouldersofthepage,straplinesaresetinreverse and against colour backgrounds to add to the appealofthe page. Examples: Main headline: Sensex gains  points ; Strapline: Revival of monsoons has done the magic. Straplinesmayalso beusedto linktherelatednewsreports, publishedthesame dayoronsubsequent days.Thisisdonethroughtheuseofakeywordto indicate that the reports are related. Thus when a former Miss India, Nafisa Joseph, committedsuicide, herfirstname‘Nafisa’wasusedto linkallthereportsonthe subject.To separatethelinkwordfromtherest ofthestrapline, theformer(link word)iscapitalized.HeadlineandLeadWritingEditing Example: Main headline: She packed her bags, was ready to leave ; Strapline :NAFISA: Was to marry next week, Mom blames fiancé for her suicide. Ina newspaper, it mayappear as follows: She packed her bags, was ready to leave NAFISA: Was to marrynext week, Momblames fiancé for her suicide Main headline: ‘She touched us with her elegance’; Strapline: NAFISA: An MTV colleague recounts .

FEATUREHEADLINES Feature headlines are used for feature stories or soft news stories. They are differentfromtheheadlinesusedforhardnewsstories.Insteadofrelyingonfacts of the news content solely, these also add a surprise or colour factor for the reader.  Difference from News Headlines Afeaturestory,unlikehardnews,hasamorepersonalizedandsubjectiveapproach to the subject. Consequently, more adjectives and verbs are allowed infeatureheadlines which canbe wittyand have inthemanelement ofsurprise.Allthis lendsflexibilityinthe use offont andcolourinheadlinesthat maynot beinthe same font or colour as that ofthe bodytext.

Definition of a Lead A lead is defined as the opening paragraph ofa news storywhich is crisp and hastheroleofgrabbingthereader’sattention.Itisanoutlineofwhat willfollow inthe subsequent paragraphsindetail. The Ws and H Appr oach: Alllead writers follow the Ws (WHAT,WHEN, WHO,WHERE, WHY)and -H (HOW) approach. Having alreadyread the headline, one wants to know more about the story. This quest for knowing more decides the content ofthe lead. The four-Ws(who, what, where, when) -and–one-H(how) techniqueis employed to conveythe factualdetails ofthestory. Thewhy,however, helps in getting to the core ofthe issue and its reason for happening. WHO: This involves giving answers to questions such as ‘Who all are involved?’ WHAT:‘Whatisthestoryallabout?’typequestionsgovernthiscomponent ofthe lead. WHEN:Informationabout thedateandtimeofthehappeningofthestory orthescheduleddateandtimeoftheeventconstitutesthispart ofthelead. WHERE: The place ofthe event is also to be included. WHY:Factsaboutthereasonfortheoccurrenceofcertainthingsorevents are also mentioned inthe lead so that the qualityofthe storyis enriched. HOW: Giving answers to questions such as ‘How the series of events unfolded?’constitutes thispart ofthelead. Subject-Verb-Object Approach Forthereader’sclarity,leadwritersusuallyfollowasubject-verb-objectsentence structure that makesthe idea ofthe lead straightforward. Consequently, using active rather than passive voice is the most favoured way of writing a lead sentence. Examples: “Three people were killed on Tuesday .…” Alternatively, “ Three people died ” would also be acceptable. Twopeoplewerearrested. Analternativeapproachbeginswiththepolice: The police arrested two people.

Example: Two children were killed today when a car jumped the road divider near Nehru Park in Central Delhi and ran them down. Ten others in the group were injured with two in critical condition . Descriptive Lead Asthenamesuggests, thistypeofleadismoredescriptiveandexplanatory.It is used to explaina person, or a scene or an event indetailin response to where andwhoquestions.Awell-writtendescriptiveleadisapicture-in-wordsdescription giving the audience afeelingofbeing onthespot where the news happened. Examples: Before going into a trance, Mrs Pamela Chowdhary slowly murmured five, four, three, two, one, and gave birth to a ten-pound baby girl. The government offensive launched to clear roving ISIS guerrillas has started giving results. Moreover, to get insightsfordescribingthe event lucidly, it is better to contact variouseyewitnesses. Question Lead It issaidthat newspaperreaderslookforanswersinastory. Henceleadsposing questions are generallyavoided. However, a proactivequestioncanbeusedto generateinterestandtheanswertowhichisfoundinoneormoreofthefollowing paragraphsmakingthe bodyofthe story. Examples: What happened in the city of Delhi in the afternoon of stNovember ? Who all were involved and how did they harm the community? Mr Chowksi had fled the country without a valid passport. Punch/Caption Lead Inthistypeoflead, strongverbsanddirect sentencesareusedwiththeobjective ofcreating maximumimpact. Suchanimpact is achieved byjolting the readers withactionwordswrittenina simple way. Examples: The Chancellor is dead. The RBI suffers monentary crisis. Thecaptionleadcomeshandywhenthecopywriterisarmedwithanunexpected piece ofinformationthat hasto be conveyed inahard-hittingmanner. Example: Neither trees nor birds. All gone . The above lead about the ill-effects of deforestation will be highly impactful. Punch leads are used sparingly so that their impact in terms of shock to the readersis retained. . KINDS OF LEADS II Leadscanalso becategorizedbaseduponthesubject orcontext ofthecontent. QuotationLead, Contrast Lead, Staccato Lead andYou Lead.HeadlineandLeadWritingEditing Quotation Lead Quotesprovide colour and credibilityto the storybyrecording the facts as theycome fromthenews maker. But quotesare generallyparaphrased to drop the words whichmaydecrease the story’s impact. The other objective ofparaphrasing is to save the newspaper space and so also the reader’s time. However, no paraphrasing is allowedat the cost ofintent and themeaning of the quote that is generallyintendedto add anelement ofinterest suchas surprise, humour, contrast or compassionto thestory. Example: In , the Indian PM Atal Behari Vajpayee said to his fellow parliamentarians: Governments will come and go but the country must remain intact. Contrast Lead Thistypeofleadis based ondrawing comparisonsbetweentwo situations. Suchcomparisonsbetweenwhat washappening thenand what is happening now, betweenold age and youthor evenbetweenwhat is happening elsewhereandwhat ishappening here—the locationofnewsevent. Example: Two years ago, two school friends pooled in their pocket money to start a website to provide doctors’ service online. Today that website has million unique visitors and , regular clients . Staccato Lead Staccato lead is used whenthetimeelement isat the primefocus and the most important informationisinthelastline.Tocommunicatetheprogressionintime, a series ofphrases with recurring punctuation marks are used. Its structure is similarto that ofa descriptive lead. Example: Almost thirty years ago, back in , after years of uninterrupted happiness in her country home, the light went out of Mrs Divya’s life - she lost her eyesight completely. This year in May her prayers were answered suddenly - now she could see. You Lead You Lead addresses the reader directly. It maybe written as a question being asked to the reader or a statement that connects with the reader directly. Implications ofthe news event mayalso be used to developYou Lead. Example: If you are an empathetic leader, you will easily identify the signs of whether your subordinate wants to quit or is just bored. Blind Identification Lead Inthis type oflead, the identification ofthe newsmaker is dropped or delayed becausewhathashappenedto himisofimportanceeventhoughheisnotawellknownpersoninhiscommunity. However, hisnameisusedinthemainbodyof thestory.Thisisdonetoensurethattherelevanceandthenewsvalueofthestory are not lost. Examples: A -year-old man instead of his name. An army commando’s son was attacked on Mall Roadthis morning. The victim Kailash, , has been admitted to AIIMS Trauma Centre where his condition is said to be critical .

This is generally achieved throughaquestionoracolourfulquotebeingusedastheheadlineinitself.Examples: Top tips of the magazine publishing trade. Who stole his heart? Bye-bye Advani Ji. . HEADLINEWRITINGPROCESS Writing a headline involves both the literary and technical aspects. Font size, positioningoftext, font style,widthofthetextandpresentationaresomeofthe technicalconsiderations. Selectionofwords, sentencestructureandtheheadline type are some ofthe literaryaspects. Display and Point Size Headlines have to be designed to fit into the allotted space. Thus in a three- column (-col) story, the headline must occupy three columns of type. In larger publications, generally one of the editors is assigned the job of determining the headline size, while others decide the headline content. A shorthand communication as -- (two- thirty six-two) means that the storyhas two columns requiring a point (pt) head arranged in two lines. Such a headline is also known as a double-decker head in the newsroomor the production department. Shorthandforheadlinesiswritteninthefollowingsequence:numberofcolumns, the type size and the number oflines. The height oftype size is measured in points while its width is measured in picas. The type sizes are standard. A type size, whichis equalto or smaller thanabout pt., is best used for body textandisrarelyusedforheadlines. Largerthanthispoint isusedforheadlines that follow a font size in the range of-. Such headlines are also known asdisplay type . Width, Weight, and Style Widthofa headlineis decidedbasedonthe newspaper columns allotted to the newsstory.Whenaheadlineisbiggerthanthecolumnspaceprovided, double- decker headline is used i.e., it is split in two lines instead of one. Setting the distance between letters, known as kerningthe text, also helps reduce space betweenthewords, allowingtheheadlineto fit into thegivenwidth. Thebolderthefontthegreateristheweightoftheheadline.Weight ofaheadline suggeststheprioritygiventothenewsstorybytheeditor.Weight isalso related to the font style chosenfor writing the headline, e.g., a storywrittenin Light / Semi Light style has lesser weight than that written in Condensed orBold. Similarly, the font style also helps to decide the weight of a news story. The headlines in sans serif font styles are soft news or feature news stories. The headlines in serif fonts have more weight. Newspapers using sans serif fonts only, opt fora font familyproviding themavarietyoffont styles and weights. Deciding News Angle Generally, NewsAnglemeansperspectivebasedonsomeelement orpointofthe story.

Writing the Headline The best wayto write anattentiongrabbing headlineisto understandthestory fully.Thus, having got agoodidea ofthe story, thesub-editoris ableto reflect it correctly in the headline. Under headline pressures, most sub-editors/copy editorsonlyread the opening linesofthe storyto come upwitha headline.At times, afactorafigureburiedinthebodytext canalsobeusedasasellingpoint intheheadline. Afterwritingtheheadline, one shouldalwaysget a third-personto checkit for its language and impact. Headlines using redundant words are best-dropped. Similarly,ambiguityhasnoplaceinheadlines.

KINDSOFHEADLINES Headlinescanbeclassifiedintovariouscategoriesbasedontheirstructure,context, presentationandpositioning. Label Headline This type ofheadlinedoes not have a verb. It is alabelandis similar to a book title. Inshort, a headline without a verbis called a labelheadline. Examples: This year’s Padma awards. A season of Holi festivities. A labelheadline is a rarityand is used in newspapers to show neutralityin its approachto thestory.Alabelis neutralinits approachand is easilysearchable in a database. Example: PM’s stand shows vengeance can be label-headed as The PM’s stand . Descriptive Headline Adescriptive headline is the one which describes the gist of a news story. It majorlyfocuses onWs and H ( who, what, when, where, how ) while the why part ofthe storyisoftennot part oftheheadline. Descriptiveheadlines arealso called as How toheadline when they are used for explaining the step-wise processofdoingsomething. Examples: How to form an Investing habit. Chennai team develops device to test anti-biotic resistance in just hours. Comment Headline A comment headline is the one that interprets the news partly. It adds extra meaning to the headline bylooking for something that is going on behind the scenesorbyanalyzingtheimplicationsofthenewsimmediatelyorinthelongrun. Comment does add colour to the headline and thus enhances its impact. The trendofusing comment inheadlineisgrowing thesedays. Example: Desperate Pakistan wants to sabotage the Indian bid in the FATF . Quotation Headline Aquotationheadline is the one that usesquotes inorder that its impact is not reduced or lost after it isparaphrased.Aquoteisnot a storyinitselfandhence is used to emphasizea news angle or news point. That is whyquotes are used sparselyinheadlines.Editing Examples: I didnot kill her and I do not want to be hanged. I am in full command and will get a second term: PM Question Headline Aquestionheadline is the one that evokescuriosityand highlights speculative points or provokes the reader. It is also good for pro-and-con stories. Many professionalsdo not favourit becauseit leavesthereaderguessingwhereasthe jobofa headline is to make sure that its meaning is grasped clearly.

HEADLINE PROPS Headline props are referred to as supporting headlines that provide the much needed extra words and space to make the headline more meaningful. These headline props comeindifferent formats serving different purposes. It is well- knownthat anewsreport structuredinaninverted pyramidstyle lifts the most important newspointto thetopofthestoryknownasleadorintro.Thatiswhy mostheadlinesarebuiltonthenewspointcontainedinthelead.However,several newsreports-especiallydevelopingandanalyticalstories-arebuilt onmorethan onenewspoint. Insuchcases, headlinewriterstakethemost important point in the main headline and use a headline prop to draw attention to the remaining importantpoints. In this sense, headline props are supporting headlines. Headline props can be categorizedasfollows: Shoulder or Kicker Ashoulderorkickerisasupportingheadlineplacedontopofthemainheadline andissmallerinsizebydefinition. Earlier, itwasusedto highlightthesubject of thestorybutthesedaysit isalso usedtohighlightthenewspointsnot contained inthemainheadline. Examples: Shoulder: India makes contact to meet negotiator today ; Main headline: Iraq captors give more hours .

This is done by providing additional informationthatmakesiteasyforthereaderswhoareinahurrytoscantheday’s headlines. Usually, a strapline is usedina single columnformat just below the mainheadlineanditspoint sizeis kept lessthanthat ofthe mainheadline. This differenceinpoint sizehelpsthereader to tellthemainpointsofthenewsstory fromitssubsidiarypoints.

INTRODUCTION Aheadlineisa heading consistingofwords and phrasesfalling abovethestory inanewspaper, magazine, newsletter, or website. Inradio orTV, a headline is spokenjust beforethe news storyis broadcast.Aheadline’s role isto generate audience engagement bycatching theirattention. To draw the attentionofthe audience, editorsalso use pictorialillustrations or aquote fromthe story. A lead is the first paragraph of the story. After the headline, it is the most informativeandimpactfulpartoftheentirestory. Itsroleisto leadtheaudience into the story’smainbody. Theheadlinemayhaveanelementofsurpriseoraweaimedatgeneratingreader’s interest andthe leadsatiates that interest as wellas enhances the levelofuser- satisfaction.

Definition of a Lead A lead is defined as the opening paragraph ofa news storywhich is crisp and hastheroleofgrabbingthereader’sattention.Itisanoutlineofwhat willfollow inthe subsequent paragraphsindetail. The Ws and H Appr oach: Alllead writers follow the Ws (WHAT,WHEN, WHO,WHERE, WHY)and -H (HOW) approach. Having alreadyread the headline, one wants to know more about the story. This quest for knowing more decides the content ofthe lead. The four-Ws(who, what, where, when) -and–one-H(how) techniqueis employed to conveythe factualdetails ofthestory. Thewhy,however, helps in getting to the core ofthe issue and its reason for happening. WHO: This involves giving answers to questions such as ‘Who all are involved?’ WHAT:‘Whatisthestoryallabout?’typequestionsgovernthiscomponent ofthe lead. WHEN:Informationabout thedateandtimeofthehappeningofthestory orthescheduleddateandtimeoftheeventconstitutesthispart ofthelead. WHERE: The place ofthe event is also to be included. WHY:Factsaboutthereasonfortheoccurrenceofcertainthingsorevents are also mentioned inthe lead so that the qualityofthe storyis enriched. HOW: Giving answers to questions such as ‘How the series of events unfolded?’constitutes thispart ofthelead. Subject-Verb-Object Approach Forthereader’sclarity,leadwritersusuallyfollowasubject-verb-objectsentence structure that makesthe idea ofthe lead straightforward. Consequently, using active rather than passive voice is the most favoured way of writing a lead sentence. Examples: “Three people were killed on Tuesday.…” Alternatively, “ Three people died ” would also be acceptable. Twopeoplewerearrested. Analternativeapproachbeginswiththepolice: The police arrested two people.

KINDSOF LEADS-I Dependinguponthecontentstructure,leadsmaybeclassifiedasSummaryLead, DescriptiveLead, QuestionLead andCaptionLead. Summary Lead Its objectiveis to conveymainideaofthe storyto thereader. It coversmost of the-Wsand-Handmayalso giveanideaofwhatislikelytohappeninfuture. Aprofessionalreporterwouldensurethatthemainpointsofthestoryarecovered inthelead.Failureto doso resultsinasituationknownasburiedleadordelayed leadwhichisthought to betheproofofthereporter’sinabilityto determinethe significanceofthestory. It needs to be emphasized that the lead is the opening paragraphinhard news storiesbut not necessarilyinfeaturestorieswhereintheleadiskept generallyin themiddleofthemainbodyofthestory.Theideaistoaddanelementofsurprise to it. Example: Two children were killed today when a car jumped the road divider near Nehru Park in Central Delhi and ran them down. Ten others in the group were injured with two in critical condition. Descriptive Lead Asthenamesuggests, thistypeofleadismoredescriptiveandexplanatory.It is used to explaina person, or a scene or an event indetailin response to where andwhoquestions.Awell-writtendescriptiveleadisapicture-in-wordsdescription giving the audience afeelingofbeing onthespot where the news happened. Examples: Before going into a trance, Mrs Pamela Chowdhary slowly murmured five, four, three, two, one, and gave birth to a ten-pound baby girl. The government offensive launched to clear roving ISIS guerrillas has started giving results. Moreover, to get insightsfordescribingthe event lucidly, it is better to contact variouseyewitnesses. Question Lead It issaidthat newspaperreaderslookforanswersinastory. Henceleadsposing questions are generallyavoided. However, a proactivequestioncanbeusedto generateinterestandtheanswertowhichisfoundinoneormoreofthefollowing paragraphsmakingthe bodyofthe story. Examples: What happened in the city of Delhi in the afternoon of stNovember ? Who all were involved and how did they harm the community? Mr Chowksi had fled the country without a valid passport. Punch/Caption Lead Inthistypeoflead, strongverbsanddirect sentencesareusedwiththeobjective ofcreating maximumimpact. Suchanimpact is achieved byjolting the readers withactionwordswrittenina simple way. Examples: The Chancellor is dead. The RBI suffers monentary crisis. Thecaptionleadcomeshandywhenthecopywriterisarmedwithanunexpected piece ofinformationthat hasto be conveyed inahard-hittingmanner. Example: Neither trees nor birds. All gone. The above lead about the ill-effects of deforestation will be highly impactful. Punch leads are used sparingly so that their impact in terms of shock to the readersis retained.. KINDS OF LEADS II Leadscanalso becategorizedbaseduponthesubject orcontext ofthecontent. QuotationLead, Contrast Lead, Staccato Lead andYou Lead.HeadlineandLeadWritingEditing Quotation Lead Quotesprovide colour and credibilityto the storybyrecording the facts as theycome fromthenews maker. But quotesare generallyparaphrased to drop the words whichmaydecrease the story’s impact. The other objective ofparaphrasing is to save the newspaper space and so also the reader’s time. However, no paraphrasing is allowedat the cost ofintent and themeaning of the quote that is generallyintendedto add anelement ofinterest suchas surprise, humour, contrast or compassionto thestory. Example: In , the Indian PM Atal Behari Vajpayee said to his fellow parliamentarians: Governments will come and go but the country must remain intact. Contrast Lead Thistypeofleadis based ondrawing comparisonsbetweentwo situations. Suchcomparisonsbetweenwhat washappening thenand what is happening now, betweenold age and youthor evenbetweenwhat is happening elsewhereandwhat ishappening here—the locationofnewsevent. Example: Two years ago, two school friends pooled in their pocket money to start a website to provide doctors’ service online. Today that website has million unique visitors and , regular clients. Staccato Lead Staccato lead is used whenthetimeelement isat the primefocus and the most important informationisinthelastline.Tocommunicatetheprogressionintime, a series ofphrases with recurring punctuation marks are used. Its structure is similarto that ofa descriptive lead. Example: Almost thirty years ago, back in , after years of uninterrupted happiness in her country home, the light went out of Mrs Divya’s life - she lost her eyesight completely. This year in May her prayers were answered suddenly - now she could see. You Lead You Lead addresses the reader directly. It maybe written as a question being asked to the reader or a statement that connects with the reader directly. Implications ofthe news event mayalso be used to developYou Lead. Example: If you are an empathetic leader, you will easily identify the signs of whether your subordinate wants to quit or is just bored. Blind Identification Lead Inthis type oflead, the identification ofthe newsmaker is dropped or delayed becausewhathashappenedto himisofimportanceeventhoughheisnotawellknownpersoninhiscommunity. However, hisnameisusedinthemainbodyof thestory.Thisisdonetoensurethattherelevanceandthenewsvalueofthestory are not lost. Examples: A -year-old man instead of his name. An army commando’s son was attacked on Mall Roadthis morning. The victim Kailash, , has been admitted to AIIMS Trauma Centre where his condition is said to be critical.

This is generally achieved throughaquestionoracolourfulquotebeingusedastheheadlineinitself.Examples: Top tips of the magazine publishing trade. Who stole his heart? Bye-bye Advani Ji.. HEADLINEWRITINGPROCESS Writing a headline involves both the literary and technical aspects. Font size, positioningoftext, font style,widthofthetextandpresentationaresomeofthe technicalconsiderations. Selectionofwords, sentencestructureandtheheadline type are some ofthe literaryaspects. Display and Point Size Headlines have to be designed to fit into the allotted space. Thus in a three- column (-col) story, the headline must occupy three columns of type. In larger publications, generally one of the editors is assigned the job of determining the headline size, while others decide the headline content. A shorthand communication as -- (two- thirty six-two) means that the storyhas two columns requiring a point (pt) head arranged in two lines. Such a headline is also known as a double-decker head in the newsroomor the production department. Shorthandforheadlinesiswritteninthefollowingsequence:numberofcolumns, the type size and the number oflines. The height oftype size is measured in points while its width is measured in picas. The type sizes are standard. A type size, whichis equalto or smaller thanabout pt., is best used for body textandisrarelyusedforheadlines. Largerthanthispoint isusedforheadlines that follow a font size in the range of-. Such headlines are also known asdisplay type. Width, Weight, and Style Widthofa headlineis decidedbasedonthe newspaper columns allotted to the newsstory.Whenaheadlineisbiggerthanthecolumnspaceprovided, double- decker headline is used i.e., it is split in two lines instead of one. Setting the distance between letters, known as kerningthe text, also helps reduce space betweenthewords, allowingtheheadlineto fit into thegivenwidth. Thebolderthefontthegreateristheweightoftheheadline.Weight ofaheadline suggeststheprioritygiventothenewsstorybytheeditor.Weight isalso related to the font style chosenfor writing the headline, e.g., a storywrittenin Light / Semi Light style has lesser weight than that written in Condensed orBold. Similarly, the font style also helps to decide the weight of a news story. The headlines in sans serif font styles are soft news or feature news stories. The headlines in serif fonts have more weight. Newspapers using sans serif fonts only, opt fora font familyproviding themavarietyoffont styles and weights.

Writing the Headline The best wayto write anattentiongrabbing headlineisto understandthestory fully.Thus, having got agoodidea ofthe story, thesub-editoris ableto reflect it correctly in the headline. Under headline pressures, most sub-editors/copy editorsonlyread the opening linesofthe storyto come upwitha headline.At times, afactorafigureburiedinthebodytext canalsobeusedasasellingpoint intheheadline. Afterwritingtheheadline, one shouldalwaysget a third-personto checkit for its language and impact. Headlines using redundant words are best-dropped. Similarly,ambiguityhasnoplaceinheadlines. Moreover,headlinescontradicting the storyare not to be used at all. Activity :Explainnewsanglewithexamplesfromstoriespublishedonthefront page oftoday’s newspaper ofyour choice.

KINDSOFHEADLINES Headlinescanbeclassifiedintovariouscategoriesbasedontheirstructure,context, presentationandpositioning. Label Headline This type ofheadlinedoes not have a verb. It is alabelandis similar to a book title. Inshort, a headline without a verbis called a labelheadline. Examples: This year’s Padma awards. A season of Holi festivities. A labelheadline is a rarityand is used in newspapers to show neutralityin its approachto thestory.Alabelis neutralinits approachand is easilysearchable in a database. Example: PM’s stand shows vengeance can be label-headed as The PM’s stand. Descriptive Headline Adescriptive headline is the one which describes the gist of a news story. It majorlyfocuses onWs and H ( who, what, when, where, how ) while the why part ofthe storyisoftennot part oftheheadline. Descriptiveheadlines arealso called as How toheadline when they are used for explaining the step-wise processofdoingsomething. Examples: How to form an Investing habit. Chennai team develops device to test anti-biotic resistance in just hours. Comment Headline A comment headline is the one that interprets the news partly. It adds extra meaning to the headline bylooking for something that is going on behind the scenesorbyanalyzingtheimplicationsofthenewsimmediatelyorinthelongrun. Comment does add colour to the headline and thus enhances its impact. The trendofusing comment inheadlineisgrowing thesedays. Example: Desperate Pakistan wants to sabotage the Indian bid in the FATF. Quotation Headline Aquotationheadline is the one that usesquotes inorder that its impact is not reduced or lost after it isparaphrased.Aquoteisnot a storyinitselfandhence is used to emphasizea news angle or news point. That is whyquotes are used sparselyinheadlines.Editing Examples: I didnot kill her and I do not want to be hanged. I am in full command and will get a second term: PM Question Headline Aquestionheadline is the one that evokescuriosityand highlights speculative points or provokes the reader. It is also good for pro-and-con stories. Many professionalsdo not favourit becauseit leavesthereaderguessingwhereasthe jobofa headline is to make sure that its meaning is grasped clearly.

HEADLINE PROPS Headline props are referred to as supporting headlines that provide the much needed extra words and space to make the headline more meaningful. These headline props comeindifferent formats serving different purposes. It is well- knownthat anewsreport structuredinaninverted pyramidstyle lifts the most important newspointto thetopofthestoryknownasleadorintro.Thatiswhy mostheadlinesarebuiltonthenewspointcontainedinthelead.However,several newsreports-especiallydevelopingandanalyticalstories-arebuilt onmorethan onenewspoint. Insuchcases, headlinewriterstakethemost important point in the main headline and use a headline prop to draw attention to the remaining importantpoints. In this sense, headline props are supporting headlines. Headline props can be categorizedasfollows: Shoulder or Kicker Ashoulderorkickerisasupportingheadlineplacedontopofthemainheadline andissmallerinsizebydefinition. Earlier, itwasusedto highlightthesubject of thestorybutthesedaysit isalso usedtohighlightthenewspointsnot contained inthemainheadline. Examples: Shoulder: India makes contact to meet negotiator today ; Main headline: Iraq captors give more hours. In a newspaper, it is printed as follows: India makes contact to meet negotiator today Iraq captors give more hours Strapline Intermsofitspositioning, astraplinemaybedefinedasthereverseofkickeror shoulderasitisplacedbeneaththemainheadline.Otherattributesofstraplineare almost thesameasthat ofakickeror ashoulder.Astrapline worksasanextra hook to draw the reader into a story. This is done by providing additional informationthatmakesiteasyforthereaderswhoareinahurrytoscantheday’s headlines. Usually, a strapline is usedina single columnformat just below the mainheadlineanditspoint sizeis kept lessthanthat ofthe mainheadline. This differenceinpoint sizehelpsthereader to tellthemainpointsofthenewsstory fromitssubsidiarypoints. Likeshouldersofthepage,straplinesaresetinreverse and against colour backgrounds to add to the appealofthe page. Examples: Main headline: Sensex gains points ; Strapline: Revival of monsoons has done the magic. Straplinesmayalso beusedto linktherelatednewsreports, publishedthesame dayoronsubsequent days.Thisisdonethroughtheuseofakeywordto indicate that the reports are related. Thus when a former Miss India, Nafisa Joseph, committedsuicide, herfirstname‘Nafisa’wasusedto linkallthereportsonthe subject.To separatethelinkwordfromtherest ofthestrapline, theformer(link word)iscapitalized.HeadlineandLeadWritingEditing Example: Main headline: She packed her bags, was ready to leave ; Strapline :NAFISA: Was to marry next week, Mom blames fiancé for her suicide. Ina newspaper, it mayappear as follows: She packed her bags, was ready to leave NAFISA: Was to marrynext week, Momblames fiancé for her suicide Main headline: ‘She touched us with her elegance’; Strapline: NAFISA: An MTV colleague recounts. Crosshead A crosshead’s role is to help sustain the reader’s interest in a long story by breakingitsmonotony.Acrossheadiswritteninapoint sizegenerallytwopoints more thanthe bodytype.

Acrosshead, thoughit cannot becalledaheadlinepropinthestrict senseofthe term,breaksthevisualmonotonyofthetext whenthestoryisquitelong.Itdoes so by giving the readers an idea of what is to be expected in the paragraphs followingit (crosshead).Notably, fewnewspapersarefoundusingcrossheadsin newsreportsthese days.

FEATUREHEADLINES Feature headlines are used for feature stories or soft news stories. They are differentfromtheheadlinesusedforhardnewsstories.Insteadofrelyingonfacts of the news content solely, these also add a surprise or colour factor for the reader. Difference from News Headlines Afeaturestory,unlikehardnews,hasamorepersonalizedandsubjectiveapproach to the subject. Consequently, more adjectives and verbs are allowed infeatureheadlines which canbe wittyand have inthemanelement ofsurprise.Allthis lendsflexibilityinthe use offont andcolourinheadlinesthat maynot beinthe same font or colour as that ofthe bodytext.

willfollow inthe subsequent paragraphsindetail. the ws and h appr oach: alllead writers follow the ws (what,when, who,where, why)and -h (how) approach. having alreadyread the headline, one wants to know more about the story. this quest for knowing more decides the content ofthe lead. the four-ws(who, what, where, when) -and–one-h(how) techniqueis employed to conveythe factualdetails ofthestory. thewhy,however, helps in getting to the core ofthe issue and its reason for happening. who: this involves giving answers to questions such as ‘who all are involved?’ what:‘whatisthestoryallabout?’typequestionsgovernthiscomponent ofthe lead. when:informationabout thedateandtimeofthehappeningofthestory orthescheduleddateandtimeoftheeventconstitutesthispart ofthelead. where: the place ofthe event is also to be included. why:factsaboutthereasonfortheoccurrenceofcertainthingsorevents are also mentioned inthe lead so that the qualityofthe storyis enriched. how: giving answers to questions such as ‘how the series of events unfolded?’constitutes thispart ofthelead. subject-verb-object approach forthereader’sclarity,leadwritersusuallyfollowasubject-verb-objectsentence structure that makesthe idea ofthe lead straightforward. consequently, using active rather than passive voice is the most favoured way of writing a lead sentence. examples: “three people were killed on tuesday.…” alternatively, “ three people died ” would also be acceptable. twopeoplewerearrested.

and credibilityto the storybyrecording the facts as theycome fromthenews maker. but quotesare generallyparaphrased to drop the words whichmaydecrease the story’s impact. the other objective ofparaphrasing is to save the newspaper space and so also the reader’s time. however, no paraphrasing is allowedat the cost ofintent and themeaning of the quote that is generallyintendedto add anelement ofinterest suchas surprise, humour, contrast or compassionto thestory. example: in , the indian pm atal behari vajpayee said to his fellow parliamentarians: governments will come and go but the country must remain intact. contrast lead thistypeofleadis based ondrawing comparisonsbetweentwo situations. suchcomparisonsbetweenwhat washappening thenand what is happening now, betweenold age

suddenly - now she could see. you lead you lead addresses the reader directly. it maybe written as a question being asked to the reader or a statement that connects with the reader directly.

involves both the literary and technical aspects. font size, positioningoftext, font style,widthofthetextandpresentationaresomeofthe technicalconsiderations. selectionofwords, sentencestructureandtheheadline type are some ofthe literaryaspects. display and point size headlines have to be designed to fit into the allotted space. thus in a three- column (-col) story, the headline must occupy three columns of type. in larger publications, generally one of the editors is assigned the job of determining the headline size, while others decide the headline content. a shorthand communication as -- (two- thirty six-two) means that the storyhas two columns requiring a point (pt) head arranged in two lines. such a headline is also known as a double-decker head in the newsroomor the production department. shorthandforheadlinesiswritteninthefollowingsequence:numberofcolumns, the type size and the number oflines. the height oftype size is measured in points while its width is measured in picas. the type sizes are standard. a type size, whichis equalto or smaller thanabout pt., is best used for body textandisrarelyusedforheadlines. largerthanthispoint

suggeststheprioritygiventothenewsstorybytheeditor.weight isalso related to the font style chosenfor writing the headline, e.g., a storywrittenin light / semi light style has lesser weight than that

       "'If had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized\\ntown, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford. In thoroughfares nigh the docks,\\nany considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut\\nstreets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at\\nBombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these last-\\nmentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom\\nyet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare. But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and\\nBrighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still more\\ncurious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and\\nglory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the\\nwhale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look\\nthere! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt. Here comes another with a\\nsou’-wester and a bombazine cloak. No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow\\nthat, in the dog-days, will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a country dandy like this takes it into\\nhis head to make a distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the\\nseaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will\\nburst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest. But think not that this\\nfamous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land\\nwould this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one,\\nthey look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like Canaan; a\\nland, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this,\\nnowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they?\\nhow planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country? Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and\\nyour question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all,\\nthey were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that? In New Bedford, fathers,\\nthey say, give whales for dowers to their daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You must go to New Bedford to\\nsee a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti\\ncandles. In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful\\nand bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is\\nart; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of Howers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation’s\\nfinal day. And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of\\ntheir cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me\\nthe young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous.\\n'"
